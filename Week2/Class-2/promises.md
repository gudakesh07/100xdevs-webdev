# A promise in javascript  is an object that represents the eventual completion(or faliure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

## Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations more effectively than traditional callback functions providing a cleaner and more manageable way to deal with code that executes  asynchronously, such as API calls, file I/O, or timers.
